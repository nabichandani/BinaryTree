# BinaryTree

The focus of this homework assignment was on writing recursive functions and traversing binary trees.  
The user can add and delete nodes in the tree and the extra credit of the program, which has been implemented,
was to create a tree from random nodes recieved from a seed and generate a .trav file with the preorder traversal of this tree.
hw4.asm contains all the methods for editing the tree, while the rest of the files are used to test whether adding or deleting nodes 
works.
